Homework 4:

1. Implement the bfs method in the SearchProblem class.  Method contains a comment with pseudocode and implementation hints.

2. Implement the uniformCostSearch method in the SearchProblem class.  Method contains a comment with pseudocode and implementation hints.

3. In the SearchDriver class, implement the printSolutionPath method (see its comment for details).

4. Look at the main method of the SearchDriver class.  It currently has examples of how to run the various
search algorithms, and how to get various statistics, such as number of expanded nodes, etc.

5. Modify the main method of the SearchDriver class so that it does the following:

5.a. Constructs an array containing at least 10 different instances of the SimpleGraphSearchProblem, but with the same parameters
(100 nodes, edge density of 0.1, and false for the 3rd parameter).

5.b. Solves each of those 10 instances with BFS, and output for each of those 10 runs, the number of state expansions, the
length of the path found, and the cost of the path found.

5.c. Do the same as 5.b, but for Uniform Cost Search.


6. Compute (either in your code or external from your code, such as in a spreadsheet) the 
average number of state expansions for each algorithm, the average path length found by each algorithm, and the average
path cost found by each algorithm.

7. Describe the results seen in 6.

What To Submit:

Submit your modified SearchProblem.java and SearchDriver.java, and your answer to number 7. 
No other java files need to be modified, so I don't need those submitted.
